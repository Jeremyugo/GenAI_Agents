# SQL Agent 🤖

This directory contains code for building an SQL agent that connects to a relational database and answers questions using data from the SQL database.

The Agent can:
1. List all tables in the database
2. Decide which tables are relevant to the query
3. Fetch table Schemas
4. Generate a query to answer the user's question using
5. Check its generated query for errors
6. Execute the query
7. Provide a response based on the results
